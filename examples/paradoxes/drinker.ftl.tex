\begin{quotation}
  \noindent There is someone in the pub such that, if he is drinking then everyone in the pub is drinking.
\end{quotation}

  [readtex \path{paradoxes/ONTOLOGY.ftl.tex}]

  \begin{signature*}
    The pub is an object.
  \end{signature*}

  \begin{theorem*}[Drinker Paradox]\label{drinker_paradox}
    Assume that there is a person inside the pub.
    Then there is a person $P$ inside the pub such that if $P$ is drinking then every person inside the pub is drinking.
  \end{theorem*}
  \begin{proof}[by case analysis]
    Case every person inside the pub is drinking.
      Choose a person $P$ inside the pub.
      Then $P$ is drinking and every person inside the pub is drinking.
      Hence if $P$ is drinking then every person inside the pub is drinking.
    End.

    Case there is a person inside the pub that is not drinking.
      Consider a person $P$ inside the pub that is not drinking.
      Then if $P$ is drinking then every person inside the pub is drinking.
    End.
  \end{proof}
\end{forthel}
