\noindent The \emph{Barber Paradox} is a puzzle illustrating Russell's Paradox, formulated by Bertrand Russell in 1919 \cite[p. 355]{Russell1919}:

\begin{quotation}
  \noindent You can define the barber as “one who shaves all those, and those only, who do not shave themselves”.
  The question is, does the barber shave himself?
\end{quotation}

\noindent In \Naproche we can formalize this paradox as follows.

\begin{fsignature*}
  The barber is a man such that for any man $M$ the barber shaves $M$ iff $M$ does not shave himself.
\end{fsignature*}

\begin{ftheorem*}[label=barber_paradox,title=Barber Paradox]
  The barber shaves himself iff the barber does not shave himself.
\end{ftheorem*}
