  \emph{\sn{Cantor's Second Paradox}} denotes the observation that the collection of all set cannot be a set itself.
  It was shown by \sr{Cantor}{Georg Cantor} in 1899 via his famous theorem stating that the cardinality of any set is strictly smaller than the cardinality of its powerset \cite[chapter 163]{Cantor1991}.

  \begin{theorem*}[Cantor's Second Paradox]\label{cantor_paradox_2}
    There exists no set that contains all sets.
  \end{theorem*}
  \begin{proof}
    Assume the contrary.
    Consider a set $V$ that contains all sets.
    Then $\pow(V)$ is a set.
    Hence $\pow(V)$ is a subset of $V$.
    Thus $|\pow(V)| \leq |V|$.
    Contradiction.
    Indeed $|x| < |\pow(x)|$ for any set $x$ (by \nameref{SET_THEORY_06_914271456198656}).
  \end{proof}
