  \noindent \emph{Hilbert's Paradox}, discovered around 1900 by David Hilbert, demonstates that there cannot exists a set that is closed under powerset and under union of arbitrary subset \cite{PeckhausKahl2002}.

  \begin{forthel}
    \begin{definition*}
      Let $S$ be a system of sets.
      $S$ is closed under powersets iff $\pow{x} \in S$ for all $x \in S$.
    \end{definition*}

    \begin{definition*}
      Let $S$ be a system of sets.
      $S$ is closed under unions iff $\bigcup X \in S$ for all $X \subseteq S$.
    \end{definition*}

    \begin{theorem*}[Hilbert's Paradox]\label{hilbert_paradox}
      There exists no system of sets that is closed under powersets and closed under unions.
    \end{theorem*}
    \begin{proof}[ by contradiction]
      Assume the contrary.
      Consider a system of sets $S$ that is closed under powersets and closed under unions.
      We have $S \subseteq S$.
      Hence $\bigcup S \in S$.
      Thus $\pow{\bigcup S} \in S$.
      Contradiction.
    \end{proof}
  \end{forthel}

  \noindent Using Hilbert's Paradox it can further be shown that there exists no universal set.

  \begin{forthel}
    \begin{corollary*}
      There exists no set that contains all sets.
    \end{corollary*}
    \begin{proof}[ by contradiction]
      Assume the contrary.
      Consider a set $X$ that contains all sets.
      Define $V = \class{x \in X}{\text{$x$ is a set}}$.
      Then $V$ is closed under powersets and closed under unions.
      Hence $V$ is not a set (by \nameref{hilbert_paradox}).
    \end{proof}
