  \noindent The \emph{\sn{Russell-Myhill Paradox}} is a paradox discovered by \sr{Russell}{Bertrand Russell} which states that two systems of propositions with the same so-called \emph{logical product} are not necessarily equal.
  It was discussed in \sn[post='s]{Russell} 1903 \emph{Principles of Mathematics} \cite[Appendix B]{Russell1903} and rediscovered in 1958 by \sr{Myhill}{John Myhill} \cite{Myhill1958}.

  \begin{signature*}
    Let $P$ be a system of propositions.
    The logical product of $P$ is a proposition $p$ such that $p$ is true iff every element of $P$ is true.
  \end{signature*}

  Let $\sqcap P$ denote the logical product of $P$.

  \begin{theorem*}[Russell-Myhill Paradox]\label{russell_myhill_paradox}
    It is wrong that
    \[ \sqcap P = \sqcap Q \implies P = Q \]
    for all systems of propositions $P, Q$.
  \end{theorem*}
  \begin{proof}
    Assume the contrary.
    Define $Q = \{ q$ : there exists a system of propositions $P$ such that $q = \sqcap P$ and $q \notin P \}$.
    Consider $q = \sqcap Q$.
    Then for any system of propositions $P$ such that $\sqcap q = P$ we have $P = Q$.
    Hence $q \in Q$ iff $q \notin Q$.
    Contradiction.
