\noindent The \emph{Russell-Myhill Paradox} is a paradox discovered by Bertrand Russell which states that two systems of propositions with the same so-called \emph{logical product} are not necessarily equal.
It was discussed in Russell's 1903 \emph{Principles of Mathematics} \cite[Appendix B]{Russell1903} and rediscovered in 1958 by John Myhill \cite{Myhill1958}.

\begin{fsignature*}
  Let $P$ be a system of propositions.
  The logical product of $P$ is a proposition $p$ such that $p$ is true iff every element of $P$ is true.
\end{fsignature*}

Let $\sqcap P$ denote the logical product of $P$.

\begin{ftheorem*}[label=russell_myhill_paradox,title=Russell-Myhill Paradox]
  It is wrong that
  \[ \sqcap P = \sqcap Q \implies P = Q \]
  for all systems of propositions $P, Q$.
\end{ftheorem*}
\begin{fproof}
  Assume the contrary.
  Define \[Q = \fclass{q}{\classtext{there exists a system of propositions $P$ such that $q = \sqcap P$ and $q \notin P$}}.\]
  Consider $q = \sqcap Q$.
  Then for any system of propositions $P$ such that $\sqcap q = P$ we have $P = Q$.
  Hence $q \in Q$ iff $q \notin Q$.
  Contradiction.
\end{fproof}
